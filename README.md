# excel-splitter
An application that splits a single Excel file into multiple files

## Features

- Allows you to decide the number of top rows to be treated as headers (these will be repeated as headers in each individual split file).
- You can choose to split by max rows per file, or by the number of files you want to recieve as the output.

## Example

I tested the application on a 100 MB .xlsx file with realistic data, from [https://examplefile.com/document/xlsx/100-mb-xlsx]

Application:
